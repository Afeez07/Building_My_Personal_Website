# Personal Website

This repository contains the HTML code for my personal website, showcasing my profile, skills, and key projects.

## Contents

* `index.html`: The main page of the website, providing an overview of my background and skills.
* `Key Project.html`: A page listing my key projects with descriptions and links to the projects.

## Key Features

* **Profile Overview:** The `index.html` page provides a concise summary of my skills and experience as a Data Analyst, Data Science & Blockchain Expert.
* **Skills Showcase:** Both technical and soft skills are clearly listed.
* **Project Portfolio:** The `Key Project.html` page highlights my key projects with links to relevant repositories and visualizations.
* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and viewable on different screen sizes (although styling could be improved).

## Technologies Used

* HTML5

## To View the Website

You can open the `index.html` and `Key Project.html` files directly in any web browser to view the website.

## Areas for Improvement

* **Styling:** The website currently lacks CSS styling.  Adding CSS would significantly enhance its visual appeal.
* **Image Hosting:** The profile picture is currently hosted on LinkedIn.  It would be better to host it locally.
* **Semantic HTML:** Using more semantic HTML5 elements could improve accessibility and SEO.
* **Accessibility:** A more thorough accessibility review is needed.

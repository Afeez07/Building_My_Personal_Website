* **Project Portfolio:** The `Key Project.html` page highlights my key projects with links to relevant repositories and visualizations.
* **Basic Styling:** The website includes basic CSS styling for improved appearance.

## To View the Website

You can open the `index.html` and `Key Project.html` files directly in any web browser to view the website.

## Areas for Improvement

* **Layout:** While tables are used for some layout, consider using CSS (Flexbox or Grid) for more robust and maintainable layout control.
* **Styling:** The current CSS provides a basic foundation, but further styling could greatly enhance the visual appeal. Consider refining colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.
* **Image Hosting:** The profile picture is hosted on LinkedIn. It would be better to host it locally.
* **Semantic HTML:** Consider using more semantic HTML5 elements for improved accessibility and SEO.
* **Skills Readability:** Breaking the skills lists into individual list items would improve readability.
* **Character Consistency:** Ensure consistent character encoding and styling.
